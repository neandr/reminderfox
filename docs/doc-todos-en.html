  ToDo's/Tasks and Lists/Subscription</h3>

  <p>'Tasks' are events that may have a start and/or end time.
    <br>Example: <code>Register for sports course on Monday 10:00 to 12:00 h.</code>
    <br>There is a separate tab for 'Tasks'. This task list and its columns are very similar to those of the appointments.
    <br>Own task groups can be added as 'Individual Lists'.</p>

  <h3 id="todo">Add Tasks/Todo's</h3>
  <p>Adding a task is the same as adding an appointment. The task basically has
    the same options as an appointment.<br>
    Unlike appointments, the date is optional here.
    Additionally there is the option "Show in tooltip". If this option is selected, the task is displayed
    in the tooltip when the mouse pointer is moved to the loop symbol of the status bar.</p>

  <!--
<h3 id="r0">ToDo's/Tasks</h3>
  <p>ToDo's are good for tasks that may or may not have a specific start date or completion date. example: "Need to sign up for gym membership". There is a separate tab for ToDo items. The ToDo list and columns are very similar to the Reminders List:</p>
  <p><img title="List with 'ToDo' tab selected" alt="en/todolist.png" src="pics/todolist.png" style="height:60%;width:60%;padding-top:15px"></p>

  <p><img title="Add ToDo" alt="en/addtodo.png" src="pics/addtodo.png" style="padding-top:15px"></p>
  <p>Adding a ToDo is just like adding a reminder. It has essentially the same options as reminders. Unlike reminders, entering a date for ToDo's is optional. In addition there is an option to Show In Tooltip. If you select this, then that ToDo will show up in the tooltip when you hover over the ribbon icon in the status bar. You may want to keep certain ToDo or List items that you don't really want to see in the tooltip all the time, so you can unselect this option in that case.</p>
-->

  <h3 id="editTodo">Editing ToDo's</h3>
  <p>You can modify ToDo items by right-clicking on them to bring up the context menu.
    Select the action that you want. Additionally, you can double-click a ToDo
    to bring up the Edit ToDo dialog.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edit ToDo</strong> - Allows you to edit all of the properties of the ToDo.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete ToDo</strong> - Deletes the ToDo from your list.</li>
    <li><strong>Move to List</strong> - Moves the selected ToDo to any other list. If the ToDo has a date set, you can also move it to the Reminders list.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Important</strong> Toggles the ToDo's important status. This is to give emphasis to extra-special ToDo's. Important ToDo's will show up highlighted in the list of ToDo's and in the tooltip.</li>
    <li><strong>Complete</strong> - ToDo's can be marked as Completed. This is useful for ToDo's that you finish with.</li>
    <li><strong>Show in Tooltip</strong> - Toggles whether you want the new ToDo item to be shown in the tooltip when you hover over the ribbon status icon.</li>
    <li><strong>Move ToDo Up/Down</strong> - Moves the selected ToDo(s) up or down in the list. This is useful if you like to keep your list of ToDo's sorted by precedence.</li>
    <li><strong>Find</strong> - allows you to search for a ToDo containing specific text</li>
    <li><strong>Hide Completed Items</strong> - This hides all ToDo's that have been marked complete. This option
      overrides your global preferences and only takes affect while viewing the current window.</li>
    <li><strong>View as HTML</strong> - this displays your current list of ToDo's in a browser window. This can be used to print your ToDo's</li>
  </ul>


  <h3 id="userlists">User/Individual Lists</h3>
  <p>In addition to appointments and tasks, further lists can be created. These
    can then be called up via separate tabs. </p>
  <p><strong><img title="Aufgaben" src="pics/rmFx_Todos.jpg" alt="de/rmFx_Todos.jpg" /></strong></p>

  <p>These lists could include: Movies (with release date), albums (for new releases),
    shopping list or whatever can be combined in a list. This is for
    people who like to work with lists.
    <br>
    Individual lists are identical to the task list. Thus, all options and settings are the same.
    With the context menu entries can be moved within a list as well as to any other list.</p>

  <h3 id="userlistsedit">Edit User/Individual Lists</h3>
  <p>The default for lists can be edited in the settings/options under the tab 'Lists'.
    <br>
    <p><strong><img title="Listen" src="pics/rmFx_optListen.png" alt="de/rmFx_optListen.png" /></strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>The call displays the names of the existing lists.
      Edit the lists using the buttons:
      <ul>
        <li> [Add] opens a dialog to create a new list. The name for
          this lists can be freely chosen, it also serves as the tab name in the Reminderfox dialog.</li>
        <li>[Edit] allows to change only the name of an existing list.</li>
        <li>A List will be deleted after activating the line with the list name and then using the [Delete] key.
          <br><em>Note: All entries of that list will be deleted!</em>
        </li>
        <li>The list order can be changed using the [Up] and [Down] keys. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="subscription">Subscription</h3>
    <p><em>Note: For 'Subscription' see also <a title="Hinweise  [faqdetails]"
      href="doc-faq-questions-en.html#subscription"> FAQ: When to use Subscription?</a> </em></p>
    <br>
    <p>Subscriptions are displayed within Reminderfox as a special task list.
      The setup and editing is done -- as with 'Individual lists' -- via
      "Option: Lists" and the dialog [Add List].</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong><img title="Subscription" src="pics/rmFx_optListenSub.jpg" alt="de/rmFx_optListenSub.jpg" /></strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition, the "Subscription URL" determines from where the list is subscribed.
      As with other individual lists, the subscription can have any name.
      <br><em>Note: Subscription lists have protected fields that cannot be changed.
        However, each entry can be moved to appointments or other task/todo lists.
        There it is possible to edit the reminder.
      </em>
