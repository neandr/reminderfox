<h2 id="views-editor">'Views' Editor</h2>
<p>Defining many reminders/todos with Reminderfox makes a long <strong>Main List</strong> and a <strong>Calendar</strong> with many day entries. Moreover it can be hard to see the right ones, a focus to specific events or groups of events can be hard.</p>
<p>Reminderfox offers 'Filter', but this let the user select only one of the attributes <em>(Description, Categories, Notes or Location)</em> a time. 'Views' are basically also filters, but can work with multiple attributes and can be combined with AND or OR logic.</p>
<p>The <strong>'Views Editor'</strong> dialog let the user define and edit those 'Views'.</p>
<h3 id="open-the-view-editor">Open the <strong>View Editor</strong></h3>
<p>It's opened on the <strong>Menu Main Bar</strong>, if the Main Menu Bar only shows the <strong>Spyglass</strong>, a click on it will show additional elements.
<img title="Spyglass to open the Filter/Views menu" alt="" src="pics/rmFX_views_0.png" width="480" vspace="40" />
<br>The left box is the normal 'Filter' to select with one attribute, the right drop down is the <strong>Filter/Views </strong> menu. The first parts shows time related filters, the second part holds the  'Views'.
<br><img title="Filter/View Menu" alt="" src="pics/rmFX_views_1a.png" width="320" vspace="40" /></p>
<p>Finally there is a <strong>[Manage Views ...]</strong> which opens the <strong>View Editor</strong></p>

<h3 id="view-editor-usage">View Editor Usage</h3>
<p>The 'View Editor' has three parts</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 55px;">
<li>Views box -- lists all defined 'Views'</li>
<li>Criteria box -- lists all criterion for a selected 'View'</li>
<li>Criteria Edit Row -- the area where the add/edit of a criteria is done</li>
</ul>
<p>The picture above is used to show how a specific 'View' is maintained.</p>

<h4 id="select-a-view-for-edit">Select a 'View' for Edit</h4>
<p>From the left text box, select a 'View'; the picture above has the "Kati (m)" selected. With that the already defined criteria are shown in the 'criteria box'. Our example has two definitions:</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 55px;">
<li>Description:Medicine</li>
<li>Date: 1W,4W</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="select-a-criteria-for-edit">Select a 'Criteria' for Edit</h4>
<p><img title="Description criteria" alt="" src="pics/rmFX_views_3.png" width="320" /></p>
<p>Selecting a 'Criteria' row sets the 'Criteria Edit Row' elements,
<em>for our example</em> 'Description' and in the textbox the string "Medicine". The text can be changed and <strong>[Edit]</strong> will write the new string to the criteria box above, also the edit row is disabled.</p>
<p>More criteria can be added with the <strong>[Add]</strong> button above the criteria box, also any definition (row) can be deleted with <strong>[Remove]</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="date-criteria">Date Criteria</h3>
<p>The definition for a "Date" has some special points to remember. Generally a 'Date' definition is always "floating" -- it's always related to the <em>current date</em>, the moment the Reminder Main List / Calendar is filtered with a 'Date' criteria.</p>
<p>Our example has <strong>"Date:1W,4W"</strong>, this is read as: looking for reminders/todos with start date one week (ahead/into the future) AND four weeks (ahead/into the future) <em>related</em> to "today". So only reminders falling into this time span will be selected.</p>
<p>Selecting the 'Date:1W,4W' row will put the values into place:
<p><img title="Date criteria" alt="" src="pics/rmFX_views_4.png" width="320" vspace="10" /></p>
<p>The 'Criteria Edit Row' now has</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
<li>the "Date" dropdown is selected</li>
<li>two boxes with [1W] for "Date Span Begin"  and  [4W] for "Date Span End"</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving the cursor on a boy will open a dialog to allow selecting the date span:</p>
<p><img title="Date criteria" alt="" src="pics/rmFX_views_4a.png" width="320" vspace="15" /></p>
<p>The dialog for "Begin" and "End" are similar to set:</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
<li>past or future  --  defines the start/end date in the past or future</li>
<li>selection for a span of Day(s), Week(s), Month(s) or Year(s)</li>
<li>a box for the value of the span</li>
</ul>
<p>As can be seen, moving the cursor over the start/stop box will show the calculated date for the selection:
<em>    our example</em> is edited on July 7th, "1W" = one week from 'today' is July 14th. Because the "Date Span End" has [4W] and also this is related to "today" the resulting "Date Span" will be July, 14th until August, 5th.</p>
<p><em>Note: Setting one of the Date Span values to a "0" zero value will interpret the other as the "Date Span Start" and the Date Span always will start at "today".</em></p>
<p></p>

<h3 id="criteria-and-or">Criteria AND / OR</h3>
<p><em>A 'view' with multiple 'criteria' works as an <strong>AND
--&gt; </strong></em>The example above works like this:  select all reminders/todos with the defined 'Description:Medicine' <em>AND</em> the defined 'Date' span.</p>
<p><em>Multiple criteria with the same attribute type work as an <strong>AND</strong></em>
--&gt;  Two rows with separate definitions "Description:Mail" and "Description:Send" would look for reminders/todos with <strong>both</strong> keywords in the description/summary.</p>
<p><em>Multiple values for one criteria separated with an comma work as an <strong>OR</strong></em>
--&gt;  A definition "Description:Mail,Send" would look for reminders/todos with at least one of those keywords in the description/summary.</p>
