<h3>[2019-11-14] Reminderfox News Date</h3>

<p>Reminderfox has a new home for the documentation
  <a href="https://neandr.github.io/reminderfox/">neandr.github.io/reminderfox</a>
</p>

<p>This change was necessary because the pages of reminderfox.org were closed.
</p>

<p>The new home contains English and German documentation.
<br>The German documentation is called with the application (Thunderbird)
installed in German.
<br>All other language installations show the English documentation.
