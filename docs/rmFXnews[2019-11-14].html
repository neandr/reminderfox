[2019-11-14] Reminderfox News Date

Reminderfox has a new home for the documentation https://neandr.github.io/reminderfox/
This change was necessary because the pages of reminderfox.org were closed.

The new home contains English and German documentation.
The German documentation is called with the application (Thunderbird)
installed in German.
All other language installations show the English documentation.
