<h2>How do I completely uninstall ReminderFox?</h2>
<div>

Why would you want to do something ridiculous like that??
However, if such a need does arise, simply uninstall the extension via the Firefox or Thunderbird extension manager:
In the Firefox/Thunderbird file menu, go to Tools --&gt; Add-ons, and find ReminderFox in the list.  Then click the Uninstall button.
Then delete the reminderfox directory stored in your Firefox or Thunderbird profile directory, such as:

<code>C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\qf5aadhx.default\reminderfox</code>
