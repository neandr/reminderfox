    <h4>Please be sure not to use TB68!</h4>
<p>Reminderfox up to 2.1.6.X doesn't run on Thunderbird version greater than version 60.* (60.9.1 would be OK).</p>
<br/>
<p>If your system was automatically updated to TB version 68 and it seems you have lost your reminders/tasks .. don't worry those are on your system without change.
  You need to reinstall Thunderbird 60 and make sure it's not updating to version like 68.</p>

<p>1. Find your OS and language TB version here https://releases.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/60.9.1/</p>
<p>2. Download and install your selected version (after you closed TB before)</p>
<p>3. Start TB and on the main menu open 'Edit' --> 'Preferences'  (maybe different on WIN or MAC)</p>
<p>4. Select the tab 'Advanced'</p>
<p>5. There you check the selection "Never check for updates"</p>
<p>So you have installed TB 60.9.1 and your current Reminderfox with all reminders/evnets/tasks etc should be back.</p>

<h3>[2019-11-14] Reminderfox News Date</h3>

<p>Reminderfox has a new home for the documentation
  <a href="https://neandr.github.io/reminderfox/">neandr.github.io/reminderfox</a>
</p>

<p>This change was necessary because the pages of reminderfox.org were closed.
</p>

<p>The new home contains English and German documentation.
<br>The German documentation is called with the application (Thunderbird)
installed in German.
<br>All other language installations show the English documentation.
