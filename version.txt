      a local change send to remote would mismatch the etag/ctag
      "Remote Calendar Sync" extended handling
   Note: Testing with GCal showed a GCal/Alarm handling doesn't change the CTag/ETag,

Externalized more strings.

2014-12-22

Fixed - was showing two alert sliders on startup
Fixed - was not reading in alert/todo lastack on startup so alarms were not being fired (as they explicitly were
ignored if missing last ack)

2014-11-26
Added new external preference per user request to control the delay in opening up multiple alarm dialogs if
user preference is set to use multiple windows instead of a single tabbed dialog:
   reminderfox.overlay.getAlarmDelay



update  2014-04-15 ____version 2.1.5 (release)
   calDAV updates/housekeeping

update  2014-04-13 ____version 2.1.5 (test)
   CalDAV Sync failed on FX/TB start with new event for first calendar
      At start removing an event failed
   Provision to better trace for data loss at startup


Updates 2014-02-13 ___ version 2.1.4.2 (release)
   CalDAV Sync requesting for a calendar which throws an error (not available,
      wrong PW, etc) now opens a XUL dialog with error detail, it has buttons to
      go for Options tab:Sync or just skip that calendar without a fix.

Updates 2014-02-12 ___ version 2.1.4.2 (release)
   Foxy Icon now has option to show status text as used with Foxy Bow
      (experimental)

   Gcal Sync wasn't handling the CTag correctly

Updates 2014-02-10 ___ version 2.1.4.2 (release)
   CalDAV now checks for status on remote calendar vs local (CTag) and only
      updates if required        Thank to Peter Wills's request

   Thunderbird's ability to autocomplete address entry from invitation attendees
      was brocken for TB29/30.

   SeaMonkey now works with Foxy Icon and Foxy Bow



Updates 2014-02-08 ___ version 2.1.4.1 (release)
   Editing a Todo/Task on a user list did not set the top menu selector for the
      user list but always to "Todo's"

Updates 2014-02-06 ___ version 2.1.4.1 (release)
   Deleting current instance of a recurring reminder now position in the Main List
      to a reminder with date of or near to deleted instance

   Context menu item for Add/Subscribe was not switchable with FX

   Status-/AddonBar to run ONLY the very first time after an install
      (in reminderfox.core.loadDefaultPreferences),
      as  we don't want to override user's addon-bar visibility state once
      they set it  (this was a complaint of several vocal users)

Updates 2014-02-04 ___ version 2.1.4 (release) __
   Foxy Icon with Badge now  can be placed to any bar.
      Also Options --> FX/TB can be used to disable/enable. After an enable after
      previous disable the Foxy Icon will be placed on the same bar, same position
      as before.
   Bow Icon / Today's reminder text can be placed on bars with selection on
      Options --> FX/TB or disabled

   Fixes
      -- Add/subscribe on web pages without a link failed
      --
   Known Issue
      -- FX 29 will not automatically start Reminderfox, need to open the list

Updates 2014-02-02 ___ version 2.1.4 (release) __
   FoxyBadge on MainMenu and Bow on statusbar didn't followed
      the Options --> FX/TB settings
      (also some others similar)
   NOTE:  Firefox 26 will work with Bow on statusbar.
          Newer FX version (eg. FX29) will NOT support the Addon-Bar, so this
          current version of Reminderfox can not show the Bow!

Updates 2014-01-26 ___ version 2.1.4 (release) __

   CalDAV/Remote Calendar
   -- Google Calendar with OAuth2 supported (since Sept.16th 2013 required)
   -- Configure for Remote Calendar with some improvements/fixes
        (Last account could not be deleted; usernames for remote calendars

   -- Remote calendars are updated at startup (first window only)
   -- New 'Remote' Calendar support: http://radicale.org/
         (will be delayed to version 2.1.4 next due to technical issues)

   CalDAV/Remote Calendar -- Tasks
      RFC 5545 based implementation to support compliant Remote Calendar like
      -- fruux
      -- ownCloud (tested with 6.0.0a (stable)
      -- Radicale with localhost (see docu)
      Google Calendar API for Tasks don't follow RFC 5545 but uses JSON data exchange

   Other

      + Foxy is enabled with Options or TB/FX 'Customize' dialog

      + see also on Options --> Firefox/Thunderbird tab

   -- Revised [Add/Subscribe] dialog for importing iCal/ICS data from different source
        with Drag&Drop or context menu on data source (FX,TB, Filemanager)

   -- Spyglass filters search selections for Text and Views persist between close/open of main dialog

   -- Calendar only display expandes the focused day to use the whole dialog space
   -- Calendar shows 'today' with blue border; days with 'open' events are yellow;
        'completed' events are gray but will not overwrite 'open' status;
        days with 'overdue' events are light-red and overwrite 'open' and 'completed'

   -- Send++ now tags the original message to be forwarded/replied with 'Followup' (green)
   -- Send/Invite supports searching TB Addressbook with autocomplete

   -- Print/View - Reminder with URL/Locations attributes are now active links

   -- Options pages with new structure
      + Backup Reminders - Options --> General offers 'Backup' of current
         reminders with date/time stamping
      + Category tab removed from Options pages, can be accessed directly with menu button
      + Help links will open a web page and reuse a previous opened tab.
      + With TB the web page is opened within TB on a new tab, a previous opened
        tab will be reused also


   Fixes
   -- Reminder entry for next year didn't have right year in Add dialog
   -- Web-Mail message was not opened with mail icon on main dialog
   -- Edit an entry on Todo's/User List after filtering was not possible
   -- Send++ was not working after some Gecko release changes; 'associated' repaired
   -- Send++ with Thunderbird and having the send-folder on IMAP wasn't adding
        the mail icon to be used to open the reminder. Now using 'Open associated reminder'
        will add the mail icon to the reminder/event.
   -- Events with recurrence had wrong TTT on calendar

   -- Main Dialog List and Calendar didn't show same event status with some
        Add/Edit actions
   -- Close 'About' dialog with [esc] or [Close], same with 'Update Check' dialog
   -- Alarm updated

   -- Views Editing
        Deleting criteria fixed

        with remote; failed also with adding remote calendar to existing event
   -- Add dialog change for OSX layout
