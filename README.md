## ReminderFox

The simple calendar for Thunderbird and Waterfox that displays and manages lists of date-based reminders and ToDo's.   

ReminderFox does not seek to be a full-fledged calendar system.   

In fact, the target audience is anybody that simply wants to remember important dates (birthdays, anniversaries, etc) without having to run an entire calendar application.
